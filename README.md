# LeetCodeSolutions
## My submissions for LeetCode problems I have solved.
- The java folder is a mess, in future they will be seperated out in some more organized way ie by topic / difficulty ..
- Mainly just a way for potential employers to see how I go about solving problems.
- I try to solve LeetCode problems as much as possible in my spare time to keep my skills fresh as well as a way to learn new Algorithms and Data Structures.
